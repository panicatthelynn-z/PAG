  <h1> Programming Across Generations started out as a mere STLP project, but it has become much more than that. Soon after the development stages began, the content took on a life of its own, and the project team noticed right away that this initiative is much greater than us.
        PAG is essentially a web-app that is meant to teach people of all ages to program at a very rudimentary level using the Python language. There are two levels that teach the principles of programming via Python Turtle (in the first), and more advanced techniques and mathematics (in the second). There is much more to it though. From a programming standpoint, there's a website (now online), the web-app (beta by the beginning of Feb), and an online editor and compiler (now online). Beyond that, there is superb artwork all done by the art team, and a really good web-server.
        Our goal is to create a fully-functional learning environment completely free and open source (so far, we've spent nothing in the development of all the materials), and to hopefully provide a good learning experience for anyone (but we're all high-school students, so don't expect much), and obviously, we want to win STLP competitions as much as we can (that's a given though). </h1>
